    <desc>Play as a nimble neon rabbit as you glide through the air slashing blocks, collecting carrots, care packages, and roaming through space in this fast-paced arcade-style hack-and-slash platformer! Beware, however, of any red-colored blocks or packages, and don't let your jump meter run out!!</desc>
