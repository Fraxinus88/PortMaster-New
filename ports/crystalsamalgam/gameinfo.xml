    <desc>Your ship has been pulled into an interdimensional gap and is now trapped within a field of crystal orbs.

Match 3 or more orbs to destroy them. Mix primary colors to get a secondary color, or secondary colors to get a silver orb!

Silver orbs will give you special powers when you match them.

But be aware that time is your enemy. Don't let the orb wall reach the limit range or your ship will be destroyed.
