Hello Zeritum,
I'm part of a group of developers and testers working on porting games to handheld Linux devices. Our project is named PortMaster (https://portmaster.games/), and we also have an active Discord server.

I am currently working on porting SnOut internally, and it looks and plays really great on handhelds!

It would be fantastic if you could grant us permission to include the build from itch.io/Steam in the package, this way users can download and install it on their device in one click. Without your consent, we would direct users to manually download the game from itch.io and copy it over to their device.

Either way, this game would be a superb addition to these handheld devices. 

Please note, we are not looking to profit or take credit for any of the games. Our primary goal is to introduce more games to our beloved handheld devices.

Thanks for considering our request!

Hello! Just confirming that we are talking about the free game SnOut and not the paid sequel SnOut 2? If it's the free version then go ahead and use it, preferably the Steam version as the Itch one has not been updated in a long time and may not work with the high scores board

Hellos and yes the free one
For the paid version of games we make a packager I.e translation layer and ask users to purchase the game/assets and place them in the appropriate folders
And thank you for making this really fun game ðŸ™‚
Also sadly I do not think the high score boards may work properly with the packaging layer that we have

Ah nice one! Yes this is all fine, go ahead :)
Are you able to link the discord on the download page please?
And when it's done let me know and I'll put an announcement in the discord about it, spread the word
