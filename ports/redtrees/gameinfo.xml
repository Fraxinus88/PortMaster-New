        <desc> In a small town encircled by trees, mysterious events are unfolding. Pet rabbits are going missing, people have been injured, and the townsfolk are whispering about something lurking in the woods... Since none of the adults want to do anything about this, it's going to be up to you to get to the bottom of it
Before you can do that, however, simply getting into the woods might be a problem.</desc>
