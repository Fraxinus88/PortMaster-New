    <desc>Death Rally is a strategic top-down racing game where players start with a modest budget and car, competing across 19 tracks in races against increasingly challenging opponents to earn money for upgrades. With choices of six car models and enhancements in engine, tires, and armor, players can also access the underground market for items like land mines and rocket fuel, all valid for one race. Races vary in length and structure, with players aiming to finish first or be the last one standing, utilizing boosters and track items strategically.

In addition to race earnings, players can score bonuses for achievements like wiping out all competition, completing races unscathed, or fulfilling sponsor missions. Bonuses vary based on the chosen car, with the ultimate goal being to top the championship table and defeat the Adversary on a special track.</desc>
