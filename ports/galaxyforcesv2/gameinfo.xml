    <name>Galaxy Forces 2</name>
    <desc>A single and multiplayer 2D space shooter game. Each player is in control of a ship. The goal is to kill everything to get the best score (dogfight), or race against the clock and your opponents to get the fastest time (race). There is also a mode where the players compete to transport cargo (mission), and where they cooperate (mission_coop).

There are more than 50 official levels, and a map-editor is included so you can create your own. Also online Hiscores are available.

The game is inspired by Gravity Force on the Amiga, and it could be considered a Gravity Force clone with more features.</desc>
