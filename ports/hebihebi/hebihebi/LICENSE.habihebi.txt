Hi -- my name is Tristan, and I'm part of a group of developers working on porting games to handheld Linux devices. Our project is named PortMaster http://portmaster.games

Recently, we've started adding various Godot games to these systems and would love to include your games as well. We've observed various homebrew sites simply distributing files without permission. We firmly believe in contacting creators like you to ask for consent.

Would you permit us to include your .pck files in our packages? Users must manually download the .pck files for our ports without your consent.  I'm looking at Hebi Hebi for now. 

We do not want to profit or take credit for your games. Our primary goal is to introduce more games to our beloved handheld devices, and we're also branching out to other ARM platforms.

Thank you for considering our request!
