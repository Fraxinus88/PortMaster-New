Hey Joao Araya,

My name is Jan Blokstra, I am part of a team of devs called PortMaster. We port indie games to linux handhelds. I would really love to include some of your games as well.

We've observed various homebrew sites simply distributing files without permission. However, we firmly believe in reaching out to authors like you to ask for consent. 

It would be fantastic if you could grant us permission to include some of your great Sonic fan games in our port packages. We do not seek to make money with this project, it's all a hobby for us. This is where you could find some more info about PortMaster:

Best regards,
