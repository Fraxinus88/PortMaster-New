## Notes

Thanks D-Pad Studios for creating this awesome game! https://store.steampowered.com/developer/dpad

Note: the way this game was programmed does not sit nice with lower resolution devices like the ones we support. The camera moves far away from the player, making the game slightly harder than normal. We can force supersample our resolution to fix this as this game is well optimized. 

This fix is optional:
Open your ports folder and locate the ''score.ini'' file (this is created after playing for the first time). Then depending one the aspect ratio of your device you need to set the ''resW'' and ''resH'' to the following.

4:3 = 1280 x 960
16:9 1920 x 1080
