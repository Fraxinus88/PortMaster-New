Hi. First off, great game! Secondly, I am a dev in the discord group called PortMaster. We port various gamemaker, love, godot, and other titles onto Linux handhelds. I have successfully ported your game GUM GIRL Gameboy Edition to my own Linux devices and it looks and plays amazing! I am wanting to ask you if we at PortMaster, may have your permission to distribute your game. We make no money from this and you'll be fully credited as the creator of the game and we will be responsible for the port itself. Without your consent, users will simply have to manually add their own files. Thank you for any thought you may give my request. If you'd like, come visit us on discord🙂

             Kindest regards, MadShmupper 👾
