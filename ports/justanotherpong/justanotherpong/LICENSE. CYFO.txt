That's good to hear. You have my permission.

Great -- nah, we don't need any source code. Just permission to distribute the game files (available on your itch.io) in the portmaster packages

Of course, we credit you accordingly (although, your credits are in the games already).

Sure! I'd love to contribute to the linux community.

Do you need the source code, or are the linux versions I published sufficient?

My name is Tristan, working on ports for the PortMaster Project.
https://github.com/christianhaitian/PortMaster

We make various games and ports runable on small linux handhelds and share them with the community.
Recently we've been also adding some LOVE games and I'd love to include your games as well.

I've seen various homebrew sites just distributing files but I'd rather ask for permission of the author if its okay for them.

Would be awesome to have your permission.
Your games would make a great addition on these small handhelds.

Thanks in advance! 
Tristan
