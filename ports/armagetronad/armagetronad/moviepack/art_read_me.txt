The textures and pictures have been created with Adobe Photoshop5.0,
they are based on pictures of the movie and from the work of the guys who sweated to do it.
The textures are .png file format (Mr. Moos' marvelous idea) that you can easily modify
with any picture software dealing with alpha channels.
