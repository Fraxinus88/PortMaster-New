Hi MadShmupper,

Thanks for taking an interest in my game. I'm surprised that people still come across it buried in itch.io, but I appreciate it!

I have no experience with Linux, but if you think it's worth your time then you're welcome to port it! You have my permission to distribute it.

I'm busy with the demo launch of my next game, but if there's anything I can do to help just let me know and I'll try to get around to it

Thanks,(Yozoraki)
