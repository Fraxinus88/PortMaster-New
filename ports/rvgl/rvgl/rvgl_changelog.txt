**                               RVGL Changelog                               **
********************************************************************************

21.0930a-1:
| Bug-fix release.
| Pumped network version.

Add:
  [General]
  - Linux: Builds for armhf and arm64 are now included. The 'rvgl' launch 
    script is updated to auto-detect these architectures and launch the 
    appropriate build.

Mod:
  [General]
  - Linux: The 'rvgl' launch script now uses 'ldd' in place of 'ldconfig' to 
    resolve libraries. This fixes an error message about root permissions.
  - Weapon generation and firework target display use a better offset 
    computation for the low-CoM fix.

Fix:
  [General]
  - Object Animation: Fixed interpolation glitches in sound effects.
  - Fixed a reposition immediately at countdown in some custom tracks.
  - Fixed the displayed list of stars overflowing in Stunt Arena.
  [Input]
  - Fixed a crash on Windows 7 when certain controllers are plugged in.
  [Multi]
  - Fixed various inconsistencies in the transfer of star in Battle Tag, 
    like the wrong player appearing to hold the star, timer freezing and
    inability to transfer the star.
  - Improved packet verification and fixed a bug that caused the same packet to 
    be received twice in rare occasions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

21.0905a-1:
| Pumped network version.

Add:
  [General]
  - Object Animation: Added support for lights, sound effects and sparks. Each
    bone can have a 3d sound, light and spark generator attached to it. These
    can be created and destroyed at any keyframe. Sounds can be one-shot or
    looping. See the docs for more details.
  - Object Animation: Non-looping animations (Mode 1) can now be triggered
    multiple times. Set 'TriggerOnce' to 'false' to enable this behavior.
  - For cars, the 'Weapon' key in parameters.txt is now deprecated. Instead, 2
    new keys have been added: 'WeaponOffset1' (for shockwaves and fireworks)
    and 'WeaponOffset2' (for water bombs).
  - Added support for Slovenian language (thanks to Mirko Ficko).
  [Graphics]
  - Added support for High DPI rendering (eg., on macOS with a retina display).
    This can be disabled by setting 'HighDPI = 0' in rvgl.ini.
  - Linux: Added option to keep the Desktop compositor enabled when the game is
    running. This allows smoother transition between RVGL and other windows, at
    the cost of slightly reduced performance. Set 'Compositor = 1' in rvgl.ini.
  [Multi]
  - Added support for blocking a player by IP address. The host can select a
    player in Waiting Room and use 'Ctrl + Shift + D' to disconnect and block
    the player from connecting again during the session.
  - Global Blocklist: In addition to dynamic blocking, a file containing IPs to
    block can be loaded at session start. Create 'profiles\blocklist.txt' with
    one entry per line. Then, launch RVGL with the '-blocklist' command line.

Mod:
  [General]
  - The following libraries are upgraded: SDL -> 2.0.14, ENet -> 1.3.17,
    OpenAL Soft -> 1.21.1 (Windows).
  - On macOS, assets are loaded from the 'Application Support' folder so the
    content is not lost when the RVGL.app is updated or replaced. Assets are
    copied from the bundle on first run.
  - Improved assets handling on Android and macOS. Installing the full game
    bundle (APK or DMG) over a previously installed partial bundle correctly
    copies the full game assets again.
  - Editor: Improved support for AI line creation from ghost path and curve
    generation. These features are now supported by the modern editor. See the
    docs for the updated list of commands.
  - Editor: Several message boxes are replaced with in-game messages.
  [Graphics]
  - Game window should no longer minimize when a message box is displayed.
  - Log the window size and render resolution at startup.
  [Audio]
  - Initialize audio device with a 48 kHz sample rate when available.
  - FluidSynth 2 is supported for MIDI playback.
  [Input]
  - Android: Updated the Controller Map configuration app.
  - Updated the SDL GameController mapping database.
  - Log information about Force Feedback support.

Fix:
  [General]
  - Several fixes for low CoM vehicles: (1) Transfer of electropulse between
    low-CoM and high-CoM cars not working; (2) Weapons spawning underground or
    exploding onto the car itself; (3) Trigger boxes failing hit tests.
  - Better support for flippable cars: When these cars are upside-down, weapons
    and cameras (hood and rear-view) are now oriented properly.
  - Fixed weapons like battery and electropulse crashing the game if the car
    has an empty body mesh.
  - Fixed an exploit that let the player skip through a championship race by
    repeatedly pressing Enter at the Quit menu option.
  - Fixed a collision issue when wall-riding. When merging close collisions,
    take into account alignment along all 3 axes. This fixes situations where
    the wheels clip collision polygon edges, causing the car to spin out.
  - Object Animation: Fixed a collision glitch when the car is on an animated
    platform that is moving away from the world NCP bounds.
  - Android: Fixed crash at start on Android 4.x devices.
  - Editor: Fixed empty meshes unselectable in Objects and Instances modes.
  - Editor: Fixed invalid flags causing crash in Lights edit mode.
  - Editor: Fixed selection of overlapping Fields and Triggers.
  [Graphics]
  - Fixed ball bearing texture cut off in the weapon holder.
  [Audio]
  - Fixed inconsistency in playing frontend music when music is turned off.
  [Multi]
  - Fixed a precision loss in the Battle Tag timer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

21.0125a:
| Bug-fix release.
| Pumped network version.

Add:
  [General]
  - Initial macOS release: Supports OSX 10.9 and above on 64-bit Intel and M1
    architectures.

Mod:
  [General]:
  - Packs: The packlist file included with RVGL is renamed "sample.txt" so it
    doesn't overwrite the default packlist.
  - Cups: Invalid class table entries are automatically fixed up instead of
    rejecting the cup file.
  - Cups: Support for zero tries and negative point values.
  - Cups: Custom skins can be selected by CPU cars.
  - Improved handling of missing game data. Display a helpful warning and avoid
    too many message boxes or game crashing.
  [Input]
  - Pressing F8 to take a screenshot no longer skips championship end screen.
  - Updated SDL GameController mapping files.

Fix:
  [General]
  - Cups: Fixed crash when not enough cars are available in a class.
  - Fixed unfinished players marked as finished in the session log.
  - Fixed crash and glitches when no level collision data is found or an empty
    car hull file is present.
  [Graphics]
  - Fixed crash caused by memory corruption when loading zero polygon meshes.
  - Editor: Fixed portal rendering issue in legacy renderer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20.1230a:
| Pumped network version.

Add:
  [General]
  - Content Packs: The game now supports a pack management system similar to
    tools like Mod Organizer. Content can be placed in multiple folders and
    enabled selectively through a packlist file. There is a new "packs" folder
    where packs and packlists are loaded from. The default packlist is
    "packs/default.txt".
    The command line "-packlist <name>" can be used to select a different
    packlist. This causes the packlist "packs/<name>.txt" to be loaded.
  - Custom Cups: Added support for custom championship cups. Each cup is
    defined in a text file placed in the "cups" folder. Use the "-nousercups"
    command line to temporarily disable them.
  - For custom frontends, there is a new camera view (ID 24) that is used at
    the cup selection screen when a custom cup is selected.
  - Editor: Modern editor now supports Light and Portal modes.
  [Graphics]
  - Added texture animation support for non-world meshes (*.m and *.prm files).
    Animation data is stored in the world file as usual, but models can now set
    the Texture Animation face flag, just like world faces.
  - Added support for mirrored-repeat texture mapping for levels. To use this,
    set the TEXTUREPROPS wrap mode to 2.

Mod:
  [General]
  - Editor: Modern editor is made the default.
  - Editor: No longer create dummy files in place of missing level files.
  - Session CSV once again prints unfinished players in the results table.
  - Replay and Cup selection now have search support.
  [Multi]
  - Difficulty setting is once again taken into account for multiplayer clients
    that use the "-gazzasaicar" command line.

Fix:
  [General]
  - Editor: Fixed glitchy axes in modern editor when the level has just loaded.
  - Editor: Fixed several scaling issues in modern editor. Ensure a minimum
    box size for zones, triggers, etc.
  [Graphics]
  - Fixed crash when a car using the Mystery cloth effect has no body mesh.
  - Editor: Ensure the editor text is drawn on top of other elements.
  [Multi]
  - Fixed a bug that can cause P2P connections to fail in rare cases.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20.0930a:
| Bug-fix release.
| Pumped network version.

Add:
  [Graphics]
  - Editor: New command for rotating the camera about Z axis (tilt) for a Dutch
    Angle effect. Hold down Alt and move the mouse horizontally. Use the reset
    command (C) to reset the tilt.
  [Input]
  - New command line '-nojoy' to allow completely disabling SDL2 joystick and
    game controller subsystem (similar to '-nosound' for audio).

Mod:
  [General]
  - When searching for car skins, use the folder path from tpage file rather
    than hardcoding search to the car's root folder. This allows placing the
    default tpage and additional skins in a sub-folder.
  - Android: On first run, check for game data and do not extract assets from
    the APK if the RVGL folder is empty.
  - Editor: Updated the spark generator object to support the full range of 64
    spark IDs.
  [Graphics]
  - The maximum number of trails visible at a time is increased to 256. Each
    trail supports up to 16 trail bits (Length property).
  - Editor: Swapped the zoom controls. Now use Z for zoom in, X for zoom out
    and C for resetting the camera lens.
  - Windows: Option 'Profile = 3' automatically attempts an ES 3.0 context and
    falls back to ES 2.0 mode. Removed the now redundant 'Profile = 4' option.
  - Option 'Profile = 1' attempts to create an OpenGL 4.5 Core context and
    falls back to OpenGL 3.2 Core.
  [Audio]
  - Windows: Roll back OpenAL Soft to 1.19.1 to fix several issues.
  - OpenAL version is logged to the log file.

Fix:
  [General]
  - Ensure the correct class is checked for progress unlocking.
  - Editor: Fixed flawed intersection tests that caused several issues in
    modern mode.
  - Fixed a bug in the generated session CSV where unfinished players were
    marked as finished when '-savereplays' was also used.
  [Graphics]
  - Editor: Fixed trails glitching out when switching to Objects Preview.
  [Input]
  - Fixed a potential crash when entering the controller config menu after
    hotswapping controllers.
  [Multi]
  - Ensure that clients use the default catchup mode in Battle Tag. This fixes
    yet another 'it' car speedup bug.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20.0905a:
| Pumped network version.

Add:
  [General]
  - The behavior when repositioning to start grid in Time Trial mode can be
    customized. There is a new *.inf key STARTGRIDRESET that can be 0 or 1. 0:
    reset to the node above start grid, 1: actually reset to start grid (the
    default).
  - Object Animation: New option PreCountdown in the ANIMATION section to
    disable syncing in multiplayer and always start the animation before
    countdown. This is useful, eg., for platforms that are supposed to come up
    during the countdown.
  - Level Properties: There is now support for custom slots in addition to the
    default IDs. Up to: 64 Materials, 32 Corrugations, 32 Dusts, 64 Sparks and
    32 Trails are supported.
  - Level Properties: The MATERIAL section has a new Color property for editor
    display (currently unused).
  - Replay: Race results CSV is saved along with each saved replay.
  - The game can optionally have separate base and pref paths. Use new command
    lines '-basepath <path>' and '-prefpath <path>'. If no <path> is supplied,
    the default paths are used. These folders belong to the pref path: cache,
    profiles, replays and times. The default pref path is:
    - "C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\RVGL" (Windows)
    - "~/.local/share/RVGL" (Linux)
  [Graphics]
  - Windows: Added a new Profile option for forcing an ES3 profile with ANGLE
    Direct3D11 backend. This unlocks ES3 level features, such as UBO and
    disabling mipmap generation. In rvgl.ini, set 'Profile = 3' for a default
    ES2 profile (D3D9), and 'Profile = 4' to enforce an ES3 profile (D3D11).
  - Device creation fallback: Attempt fallback modes when device creation
    fails. The order is: OpenGL (shader) -> D3D (ANGLE) -> OpenGL (legacy).
  [Audio]
  - The 3D Sound object has a redesigned Mode option (0: Continuous, 1: Random,
    2: Play Once). There is a new Start Time flag to decide the time in seconds
    before the sound is played. This is only applicable to Play Once mode.

Mod:
  [General]
  - The following libraries are upgraded: SDL -> 2.0.12, SDL_image -> 2.0.5,
    OpenAL Soft -> 1.20.1 (Windows) / 1.19.1 (Android), ENet -> 1.3.15. The
    GLAD OpenGL loader was upgraded to 2.0.0-beta.
  - Android: The app now targets API 28 (Android 9) and supports the runtime
    permission model. The minimum supported version is now Android 3.1. Support
    for the ARMv5 32-bit architecture has been removed (minimum is now ARMv7).
  - Better message box behavior: Ensure the main window is properly restored
    once the message box is dismissed.
  - Replay: Reading of replay files at startup is better optimized.
  - Editor: Zones editor now shows whether a car has gone outside zone. In
    modern mode, N key toggles AI nodes display.
  - Additional stock cars (those not part of the stack like Clockworks and UFO)
    can now have custom carbox textures.
  [Graphics]
  - Windows: Updated ANGLE libs to the 3497 branch (Chrome 69). Uses custom
    built libs for Windows XP / Vista compatibility.
  - Windows: Removed the ID for Windows 10 from the manifest for better
    compatibility with Intel drivers. This enables native OpenGL support for
    old Intel chipsets running on Windows 10.
  - Shaders: Minor optimization in fragment shader code.
  - Shaders: Cached binaries are now saved to "cache\shaders".
  - Hide HUD now hides Replay, Spectator and No Pause text.
  [Audio]
  - Android: Integer decoder (Tremor) is now used to decode OGG on both 32-bit
    and 64-bit arm devices.
  [Input]
  - Android: Better controller support and HIDAPI support. Updated the RVGL
    Controller Map configuration app.
  - Updated SDL GameController mapping files.
  [Multi]
  - Re-enabled AI rubberbanding and difficulty setting in multiplayer.
  - Don't send data for objects that are almost still. This helps conserve
    bandwidth especially for objects that are always moving, like tumbleweeds
    and wobbly cones.

Fix:
  [General]
  - Level Properties: Fixed parsing of several TRAIL properties (Fades,
    Shrinks, Expands and Length). TexturePage -1 can now be used to disable
    texturing.
  - Ensure custom level progress is loaded so OBTAIN works correctly.
  - Object Animation: Cars on top of animated objects or platforms no longer
    fall through upon reposition.
  - Object Animation: Fixed improper case handling of custom animation model
    file names. This affects case-sensitive platforms like Linux.
  - Replay: Fixed a save game issue when selecting to view replay or restarting
    the race from replay mode.
  - Replay: Fixed a bug in replay file version check.
  - Fixed crash caused by unlinked AI nodes in sprint mode.
  - Fixed an AI recovery glitch when cars drop down during countdown.
  - Fixed rounding errors in pickup randomization that can cause the player to
    get the global weapon even when the probability should be 0%.
  - Editor: Fixed inability to deselect a trigger in legacy editor.
  - Linux: Game launcher now handles arguments with quotes.
  - Better logging of loaded files.
  [Graphics]
  - Camera low CoM fix now takes the orientation of car BBox into account.
  - Windows: Fixed a flicker when launching the game in fullscreen.
  - Shaders: Fixed the order in which debug lines are rendered.
  [Multi]
  - Fixed an overflow in network traffic values (Ctrl + P).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20.0430a:
| Pumped network version.

Add:
  [General]
  - New WIND section in properties.txt to modify the behavior of Wind force
    fields. Wind can be set to affect objects only (default behavior) or both
    objects and cars; either expand (infinite size) or take the actual size of
    the field.
  - Level Obtain Support: New *.inf key OBTAIN to set the conditions to unlock
    the level. This is based on car Obtain values and take -1 to 5. R/M/RM
    variants can be set to be unlocked on beating the level's challenge times.
  - New profile.ini key 'FinalCam' to disable the special finish camera at race
    end. Setting this to 0 will always show the close-up rotating camera
    similar to the original PC version. Further, when 'FinalCam' is 1 (the
    default), replay cameras are now enabled for Battle Tag finish.
  - New rvgl.ini key 'UseProfiles' to disable multiple profiles support. This
    will automatically load the last used profile (set in 'DefaultProfile')
    similar to using the '-profile' command line. If no profile exists, a
    default profile named 'player' is automatically created (unlike the command
    line variant).
  - Added new gallery pages, contributed by MightyCucumber, and rearranged
    existing ones.
  [Graphics]
  - Added support for Adaptive V-Sync. The V-Sync option can now be set to On,
    Off or Adaptive. Only applicable for Windows and Linux with X11.
  [Audio]
  - Persistent Material Sound: There is support for playing a sound effect when
    driving on a material. A new parameter 'DefaultSound' is available for each
    MATERIAL section in properties.txt. This works similar to 'SkidSound' and
    'ScrapeSound'.
  [Input]
  - Added setting to enable or disable Force Feedback for each controller from
    Controller Settings.

Mod:
  [General]
  - DC Pack: Updated Groovster and BigVolt textures to fix wheel issues and
    pure-black. BigVolt has improved windshield and AMA text.
  - When the DC Pack is not installed, and CupDC is disabled, Rooftops is now
    hidden from the track selection screen and Progress Table.
  - Replay: Weapon position data is now stored in replay file as with other
    objects. This affects Firework, Shockwave and Water Bomb objects.
  - Editor: Calc Stats mode now computes the Weight and Trans.
  - Editor: The color of Cam Node links now disambiguates two-way links from
    one-way links. This helps fixing unintended one-way links.
  - The Probe Intro Sequence is now optional. If the 'intro' folder is removed,
    or OBTAIN is set to -1 in 'intro.inf', the game attempts to load a static
    intro slide (devlogo3[a-c].bmp) in place of the animated sequence.
  - When a reversed *.inf is found, the reversed challenge time is taken from
    CHALLENGE key in the reversed *.inf. CHALLENGEREV is deprecated.
  - Stock level info and car parameters are no longer hard-coded. The values
    are now read from the files and can be customized. Updated level *.inf and
    and car parameter files are now included.
  - Reversed customization: These textures can now have reversed variants
    placed in 'custom\reversed': fxpage[1-3].bmp and all level textures.
  - Bomb explosion now uses a dedicated 'models\bomb.m' model instead of
    reusing 'models\ball.m'.
  - Android: Game Settings menu exposes more options (MultiPlayer CPU and Show
    Ghost). The Reset Progress Table option is removed.
  - Select Profile menu is reordered as Create / Load / Delete. The default
    option remains Load (i.e., press left for Create and right for Delete).
  [Graphics]
  - Improved fence sync behavior with v-sync on or when LimitFPS is used.
  - Renamed some rvgl.ini keys for consistency: EnvFlag is now EnvLevel,
    AlphaSort is now SortLevel.
  - Android: Center HUD is now configurable from Render Settings. Removed the
    Instances option instead (which can still be set from rvgl.ini).
  - Android: The carbox and track screen positions and sizes are tweaked for
    better placement in both Portrait and Landscape.
  - Menu titles are now aligned to the top-left.
  [Input]
  - Steering Range and Deadzone settings are now taken into account for mouse
    controls and can be configured in Controller Settings.
  [Multi]
  - Restricted the frequency of jumps in Battle Tag to once every 80ms. This
    limits multiple jumps to double jumps.

Fix:
  [General]
  - Editor: Fixed crash in Instances mode with the legacy editor.
  - Editor: Fixed AI Node distances not computed for some nodes.
  - Editor: Fixed Cam Nodes linking bug with the modern editor.
  - Replay: Fixed glitch during playback right after the car flips.
  - Android: Fixed freeze in main menu after tapping on Select Profile.
  [Graphics]
  - Fixed rail camera direction not properly updated in some cases.
  - Rearview animation is disabled completely when 'AnimateRearview' is off.
  - Show the correct resolution in Video Settings when '-nores' is used.
  - Android: Fixed color band artifacts with Frame Buffer Antialiasing.
  [Multi]
  - Ensure custom animation objects are synced in multiplayer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20.0325a:
| Bug-fix release.
| Pumped network version.

Add:
  [General]
  - Editor: New selection behavior to allow selecting overlapping objects such
    as zones. Use Left Shift + Select to cycle through objects beneath the
    current selected object. This is supported in both legacy and modern editor
    modes (for Zones, Fields, Visiboxes, Instances and Objects).
  [Graphics]
  - New command line '-nores' to disable display mode change and preserve the
    desktop resolution in fullscreen. Removed the '-nofullscreen' command line
    added previously.
  - Low latency mode: New rvgl.ini key LimitLatency that can be enabled to keep
    latency under control and reduce input lag, especially with v-sync on. This
    can have a slight negative impact on performance. Set to 1 to use standard
    latency control mechanism or 2 to use Fence Sync Objects when available.

Mod:
  [General]
  - Updated DC Pack: Restored wheelXX.prm files for Groovster and LA 54 from
    the original Dreamcast content.
  - Editor: Box selection and side manipulation in lights and visiboxes mode is
    made consistent with other editors. The active box or side is highlighted
    in visibox editor.
  - Write audio and input initialization to the log file.
  [Graphics]
  - Improved loading: Use Fence Sync Objects when available to speed up loading
    when v-sync is on and Threaded OpenGL disabled. For better compatibility,
    Threaded OpenGL is now disabled by default.
  - The minimum frame rate for LimitFPS is increased to 15.
  - Shaders: Restored lights and effects layout to use distinct uniform arrays.
    Works around Intel driver bugs that cause crash during shader compilation.
  - Single-buffered window is no longer provided as a fallback option (can
    cause flickering display in some systems).
  [Multi]
  - AI rubberbanding is disabled in multiplayer. In Battle Tag, the speed of
    the 'it' car is no longer tied to the player's difficulty setting.

Fix:
  [General]
  - Editor: Fixed format detection that broke legacy field and camnode files.
  - Editor: Fixed broken link toggle and missing functions in camnode editor.
  - Editor: Fixed spherical fields not having an initial radius.
  - Editor: Fixed potential crash when deleting an instance.
  - Fixed crash while loading when using certain objects with Object Thrower.
  - Security fix to sanitise profile name before creating the folder.
  [Graphics]
  - Shaders: Fixed a UBO glitch with ANGLE ES3 API.
  - Ensure container objects (VAO) are initialized in the loading thread.
  - Editor: Fixed 3D text not highlighted on hover in zone and trigger editors
    and text being obscured by zones in shader mode.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20.0210a:
| Pumped network version.

Add:
  [General]
  - New force field format with extended options and type selection. The shape,
    direction, distribution and apply type can be configured separately, and
    new field types have been added. Use the FLDFORMAT level *.inf key to
    switch between the new and old format for saving.
  - Editor: Modern editor workflows now available for these edit modes: Camera
    Nodes, Fields, Instances, Objects, Triggers, Visiboxes and Track Zones. New
    tools added for Translation, Rotation and Scaling.
  - Sweep Camera support: New level *.inf key SWEEPCAM (0 or 1) to toggle the
    starting grid zoom camera in user levels.
  - Added support for Super Pro cars (new Rating level 5). Set cars to be
    unlocked upon Stunt Arena completion (new Obtain level 5).
  - Added command line arguments to manage user-made content: '-nouserlevels',
    '-nousercars', '-nouserskins', '-nousersfx' (for car sfx only), along with
    existing '-nouser' (for all the above).
  - Android: Ability to launch from adb shell with command line arguments (set
    through a string extra called 'args').
  [Graphics]
  - Fullscreen emulation support: new command line '-nofullscreen' for
    borderless fullscreen window (i.e., fake fullscreen).
  [Audio]
  - Custom car sfx: New parameters.txt keywords SFXHONK '<path>' and SFXSERVO
    '<path>' to use a custom horn sound and servo sound for the car.

Mod:
  [General]
  - Object Throwers can now specify lap settings in flag high similar to Object
    Animations. More objects are now throwable without crashing the game.
  - Object Animation: Collision now accounts for angular velocity of the moving
    object to support rotating platforms and objects (currently supported for
    Bone 0 only).
  - Collision is now supported for Boat and Horse objects.
  - Removed hardcoded collision bounding box for Train and Slider objects.
  - Updated stat bar ranges in car selection screen to account for Super Pros.
  - Editor: The MAKEITGOOD cheat enables all editor features that are available
    through Dev mode.
  - Editor: The currently active edit mode can be changed directly from the
    in-game menu (and press Enter to restart the level).
  - Editor: Save Car Info option now uses in-game confirmation menu instead of
    system message dialog.
  - Updated Serbian strings.
  [Graphics]
  - Shaders: Updated lights and effects layout to use closely packed data. The
    settings ShaderLights, ShaderShadows and ShaderEffects can be set down to
    zero (previously needed to be at least 1).
  - Shaders: Better mobile compatibility and improved UBO support. Properly
    detect the fragment shader precision for GLES2, and use explicit layout
    specifier for each uniform block (fixes UBO on several devices).
  - Improved fog support: Fog computation is moved to the fragment shader for
    proper per-fragment fog (avoid polygon artifacts).
  - Particle physics processing is tied to the physics rate for consistent
    behavior across different frame rates. Particle collisions are still
    processed at the display rate to avoid computation overhead.
  - Particles render setting now affects more objects (such as sprinklers).

19.1230a:
| Pumped network version.

Add:
  [General]
  - Custom Animations: Added a new object type that allows track makers to
    design their own animated objects. Each object can consist of multiple
    models (*.m with optional *.ncp collision) that act as "bones". Each bone
    is animated either freely or relative to a "parent". Animation data and
    keyframes are defined in a text file named "custom_animations.txt".
    A new trigger type is available with options to trigger the animation at a
    specific lap, the first or last lap.
  - New GRAVITY section in properties.txt to modify the behavior of the global
    gravity field (magnitude, direction, dampening and rockiness). The ROCK and
    ROCKTYPE level *.inf keys are deprecated - new tracks should set these
    properties in properties.txt instead.
  - New PICKUPS section in properties.txt to change pickup properties: spawn
    count (initial and per-player pickup count), env (shininess) color, and
    light color.
  [Graphics]

    number and date. A new "Ins:" flag is added to help deduce whether the
    record was done with instances on or off. Also brings car skin support for
    new records.
  - Added a new cheat code. It is also possible to disable previously used
    cheats by adding an '!' at the end (eg, 'CARNIVAL!' to disable cars cheat).
  [Multi]
  - Added support for pasting in chat (Ctrl + V).

Mod:
  [General]
  - Editor: Modern editor controls are improved. Operations using right click
    require holding Shift to avoid conflict with camera rotation. The camera
    no longer moves when using commands like Ctrl + S. New "chain-create-link"
    command using Ctrl + Shift + Click.
    It is now possible to move hovered nodes without having to select them. The
    behavior is improved for selecting racing lines at segment extremities.
  - Editor: Saving uses an in-game notification text instead of message box.

    GLThreaded is set to 0.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

19.0907a:
| Pumped network version.

Add:
  [General]
  - Sprint Tracks: New GAMETYPE 4 for sprint tracks (point A -> B). Tracks
    using this game type must also specify an ENDPOS defining the finish line,
    in the same format as the STARTPOS.
    The AI (*.fan) and Pos Nodes (*.pan) file formats have been updated to hold
    the ending node ID. The end node is deduced from the ENDPOS, just as the
    start node is deduced from the STARTPOS. These files must be re-saved
    whenever the STARTPOS or ENDPOS is changed. When the start and end nodes
    are different, the nodes do not have to form a loop.
  [Input]
  - Modern Editor Workflow: There is now optional support for a modern editor
    controls scheme and alternate camera controls, both of which are disabled
    by default. These can be enabled separately using new options under the
    Editor section in rvgl.ini:
    Set "LegacyCameraControls = 0" to access a modified WSAD set for camera
    movement along with same-direction Y-axis for mouse motion.
    Set "LegacyEditorControls = 0" to access the new and improved editor
    workflow. This is currently implemented for AI Nodes and Pos Nodes edit
    modes.

Mod:

    improve camera behavior at high frame rates.
  - Editor: Visimasks are no longer updated per-frame in Visiboxes edit mode.
    They are updated when saving the file. This should improve performance.
  [Input]
  - Editor: Lens zoom support has improved. Rotation speed is now consistent
    across zoom levels. The scroll-wheel zoom speed can be controlled with the
    caps lock key. Also, zoom level is preserved when switching between F4 and
    F6 modes.
  - Editor: The in-game mouse cursor is 1:1 accurate with the system cursor.
    The cursor is hidden in camera rotation mode (with mouse right held).

    line to keep using pure P2P.
  - Better P2P management with features like prioritization, order swapping and
    retry attempts to improve the chances of establishing a successful direct
    connection.

Mod:
  [Multi]

17.1124a:
17.1124s:
| Pumped network version.

Add:
  [General]
  - Custom level properties: Added support for overriding properties like
    materials, corrugation, dust, sparks and trails. Properties are loaded from
    a 'properties.txt' file placed in the level folder. For more info, see
    the online documentation.
  [Graphics]
  - Added GLProfile key to rvgl.ini settings. This does nothing, and is added
    for compatibility with the shader edition. Also updated video info log in
    sync with the shader edition.

Mod:
  [General]
  - Improved Windows setup: New UI, added option to create a Desktop shortcut.
    Further, the setup now checks whether the game data is found in the install
    path and displays a warning.
  - Windows: Updated SDL2 library to version 2.0.7.
  - The release builds now use optimization level -O3.
  [Graphics]
  - Use GLAD OpenGL loader and shared context in sync with shader edition.
  - When stepping through the Antialias setting, the FBO is recreated afresh
    rather than modifying storage (may improve performance).
  - Shaders: When running on an embedded GPU with no Desktop OpenGL support, ES
    profile is automatically used.
  - Shaders: log messages related to shader loading are clearly formatted.
  [Multi]
  - Removed the flashing 'Locked' overlay from the in-game 'Next Track' screen
    to improve readability.

Fix:
  [General]
  - Fixed broken compatibility with old replay files, introduced in 17.1009a.
  [Graphics]
  - Possible stuttering when streaming textures (like water ripples on Garden).
  - Save Screenshots (F8) now reads from the back buffer (fixes issues with
    some drivers).
  [Multi]
  - Ensure that the client's audio is stopped properly when the same track is
    restarted.
  - Messages received during sync and level load are queued to be processed at
    the end of loading. This fixes improper message handling when clients load
    too fast (eg, by using the -sload command), which can result in bad sync
    and CHT tagging. High priority messages are processed immediately in the
    background.
  - With -sload command, network tasks are run in a background thread in order
    to keep connections from timing out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17.1115s:

Add:
  [Graphics]
  - OpenGL ES 2.0 support: The popular version of OpenGL for Embedded Systems
    is now supported.
  - ANGLE Direct3D backend support on Windows.
  - New option 'GLProfile' in rvgl.ini to switch between Compatibility, Core,
    Embedded profile and ANGLE backend (values from 0-3).

Mod:
  [Graphics]
  - Switched to GLAD OpenGL loader.
  - Optimized rendering: Significant rewrite and optimizations since the
    preliminary release. Now uses multiple shader programs for world, model and
    screen space (particles, etc.) rendering with combinations depending on the
    mesh type.
  - Better optimized shader code and better compatibility for old devices
  - Transparent meshes are now rendered back to front in correct order.
  - Alpha testing (colorkeying) is only enabled for textures that need it.
  - Untextured polys now use a 1x1 pure-white texture internally.
  - The minimum requirement to run the shader edition is now OpenGL 2.0.
  - Multi-threaded assets loading: Now uses a shared OpenGL context for fast
    loading of assets in background while rendering in the main thread.
  - Re-enabled the loading screen, along with intros.

Fix:
  [Graphics]
  - Fixed broken waterbox animation on levels like Boat Beach.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17.1021a:
| Bug-fix release.

Mod:
  [Graphics]

  [Multi]
  - Players are cycled through in the spectator cam or follow cam (F3) based on
    their current race position.
  - The '-port' command line to override the LocalPort ini option now accepts 0
    to force a random port for this instance.

Fix:
  [Multi]
  - Bad default player count in split-screen when creating a new profile.
  - Glitch in name enter menu in random cars mode in split-screen.
  - Wrong player name shown in-game in random cars mode in split-screen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17.1014a:
| Bug-fix release.
| Pumped network version.

Add:
  [General]
  - Added command line "-tvtime" that enables special cameras, similar to using
    TVTIME cheat.

Mod:
  [Graphics]
  - In tvtime mode, pressing and holding Shift + Space hides in-game menu. When
    HUD is already hidden (Shift + F5), menu can be hidden with Space alone.
  [Multi]
  - Freeform (F6) camera is now allowed in Battle Tag mode after the player has
    finished.
  - Improved level verification: the following files are compared against the
    host: *.fob, *.taz, *.pan, *.fan, *.fld and *.ncp. Visual changes are not
    tagged as cheat. The verification system is also aware of "dummy" files.
  - Disabled various cheats and Edit modes in multiplayer.
  - Entering cheat codes to unlock tracks / cars no longer registers as CHT.

Fix:
  [General]
  - The currently followed player in spectator mode or F3 camera is properly
    saved after race restart.
  [Multi]
  - Fixed 'persistent cheat' bug where a player with mismatching car or level
    continues to be tagged CHT after starting a different level.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17.1012a:
| Pumped network version.

Add:
  [Multi]
  - Added command line "-sessionlog" that can be used by the host to log the
    session data to file. The session data is timestamped and saved in the
    profiles folder as csv.

17.1009a:
| Pumped network version.

Add:
  [General]
  - Allow users to specify a custom difficulty for levels with the DIFFICULTY
    line in .inf files. Supported values are 0 to 4.
  - Windows versions are now provided as installer executables (both 32-bit and
    64-bit variants).
  [Multi]
  - Server-side cheat verification: client car parameters are now compared
    against that of the host to detect cheating players. This allows custom
    cars without the CHT tag as long as it matches with the host.
  - Host can set to auto-kick cheating players (those with mismatching car
    parameters) by using the "-autokick" command line. Players with DEV mode
    enabled, but matching parameters, are tagged with CHT but not kicked.
  - New "-port <number>" command line that can be used to override the local
    port for each RVGL instance without editing the ini.

Mod:
  [General]
  - User cars and tracks are now selected by the random cars / tracks option.
  - Added minimal Game Settings in the in-game Options menu.
  - Number of cars can be set down to 1 and laps up to 255 in profile.ini even
    without dev mode.
  [Graphics]
  - Weapon counter is now shown in split-screen for fireworks and water bomb.
  [Multi]
  - Local IP and port are now also displayed for clients.
  - Updated public IP server to 'rv12.revoltzone.net'.

Fix:
  [Graphics]
  - Tweaked sand material color, skidmark and particle effects.
  [Multi]
  - LAN broadcast not working when LocalPort is set to 2310.
  - Next Track option missing in split-screen after viewing replay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    "profiles\gamecontrollerdb.txt" in addition to the default mappings
    included in the root game folder.

Fix:
  [Input]
  - Fixed hotplugging support with multiple players and controllers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17.0930a:

Add:
  [Input]
  - Hotplugging support: controllers can be added and removed while the game is
    running and they are now detected and used automatically.
  - Menu navigation uses the D-Pad by default on supported controllers.
  - Controller info including the name and GUID are now logged.
  [Multi]
  - A new rvgl.ini setting called "LocalPort" can be found under the Network
    section. This allows clients to set the port to be used when connecting to
    an online session. The default is 0, i.e., a random port is used.

Mod:
  [General]
  - Updated language files.
  [Graphics]
  - Optimized viewport clear and skybox rendering for better performance on
    tracks that have a skybox.
  - The F9 key in dev mode now shows world and model vertex count in addition
    to poly count.

    loaded automatically to support various additional controllers.
  - Menu select and back are set to buttons A and B by default on supported
    controllers.
  [Multi]
  - Updated Waiting Room layout and added new commands: use Up / Down keys to
    scroll through the player list, hold down Ctrl for faster scrolling. The
    host can use Ctrl-D to disconnect a player or Ctrl-S to put a player in
    spectator mode.

Mod:
  [General]
  - Increased the maximum number of cars to 16.
  - Reduced the probability of player getting the global star pickup.

    allowed connections.
  - Fixed bug with the "Room Full" status not detecting properly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17.0215a:
| Bug-fix release.

Mod:
  [General]
  - Reintroduce fixed timestep for camera movement and animations with v-sync
    off. A variable timestep is still used to keep the animation smooth when
    v-sync is on.
  [Input]
  - Left Stick should now be accepted in menu inputs even when Acc/Reverse is
    configured differently.

Fix:
  [General]
  - Various code cleanup aimed at the 64-bit version.
  [Audio]
  - Updated the doppler effect code to provide safe limits, avoid generating
    very large pitch values. This fixes a potential crash or lockup with some
    openal versions on 64-bit Linux.
  [Multi]
  - Fixed a bug in lag computation on 64-bit RVGL that can result in high
    latency and cars flickering on some LANs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17.0115a:
| Pumped network version.

Mod:
  [General]
  - Updated the Spanish translation for Instances option in Render Settings.

    message is now logged instead.
  [Multi]
  - The external IP service provider is now changed to 'www.myexternalip.com'.
  - P2P is now the default mode for multiplayer sessions. Use "-nop2p" command
    line to explicitly disable P2P and use client-server mode.
  - Disabled the ping displayed above cars. Ping values can still be checked
    from the debug display in Dev mode (Ctrl + Numpad Enter).

Fix:
  [General]
  - Fixed camera stuttering issues. This undoes a change introduced in v1.2
    build 15.0325 that was intended to improve stability at high fps.

    longer dependent on the frame rate.
  - Fixed audio clipping at high frame rate.
  [Multi]
  - Players on the same LAN connecting to a remote host in P2P mode should now
    be able to see each other.
  - Fixed lobby timeout not giving any error in the previous release.
  - Fixed bad 'player leaving' message sent by clients in P2P mode.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16.1230a:
| Pumped network version.

Add:
  [General]
  - This release includes additional Gallery pages from the DC version.
  [Multi]
  - Initial support for P2P multiplayer: use the "-p2p" command line to start a
    P2P session. Only the host needs to set the command line. UDP hole punching
    is used to link clients behind NAT, so no port forwarding is required for
    the clients.

Mod:
  [General]
  - Replays are now saved per-profile when using the Save Replay feature.
  - Added missing entry for libGLEW.so.2.0 in the 'rvgl' launch script.

Fix:
  [General]
  - Time Trial records and ghosts not loading in Linux after running the
    fix_cases script.
  [Graphics]
  - Possible alpha transparency glitch in saved screenshots.
  [Multi]
  - 'No countdown' bug when a fast client finishes loading when the host is
    still at the sync screen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16.1210a:

Add:
  [General]
  - Added missing texture files for the Trolley car.
  [Graphics]
  - New implementation of multisample anti-aliasing using Framebuffer objects.
    Antialias is now a proper option under Render Settings, and changes take
    effect instantly. The command line "-multisample <num_samples>" can be used
    to initialize a multisampled opengl window the old fashioned way, without
    framebuffer objects.
  - Screenshot support: automatically save screenshots from the game using F8
    key. The screenshots are timestamped and saved in the profiles folder in
    PNG format.
  [Audio]
  - Added libsndfile decoder to support various compressed WAV formats.

Mod:
  [General]
  - Updated the collision poly limit to accomodate instance collpolys. The
    maximum polys supported by the world ncp file is limited to 65536. However,
    it's now possible to add any number of additional instance ncp files, i.e.,
    the total number of world + instance collpolys can now exceed 65536.
  - The unlocking behavior and CPU selectability of BigVolt and BossVolt are
    now restored based on the original DC version.
  - Improved logging to display additional details and log error messages.

Fix:
  [General]

  [General]
  - Updated the Dreamcast pack with the latest files.
  - Localized the "Windowed" text in Video Settings.
  - Log the OS and architecture to the re-volt.log file.

    into account the interval between packets). This avoids increased delay in
    case of low pps.
  - Debug display is now invoked with Ctrl + Numpad Enter (Dev mode).
  - Show lag and interval values in multiplayer debug display.
  - Car / object position updates are now sent in a separate enet channel.

Fix:
  [General]
  - Fixed bug in .lit file saving in Lights edit mode.
  - Fixed crash after selecting give up try in Championship mode.
  - Dev mode: don't add a camera section when saving car info if the car
    doesn't use one.
  [Multi]
  - Reducing the number of cars from Game Settings in an online session now
    properly sets any extra players to spectating mode.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16.0920a:
| Pumped network version.

Add:
  [General]
  - Additional content: added support for additional cars from the DC version
    (available as a separate optional download). This adds BigVolt and BossVolt
    to the car selection screen. It is possible to use the original Dreamcast
    frontend.fob file to bring the same carbox layout as the DC version (i.e.,
    all carboxes displayed on screen).
  [Input]
  - Support for modern game controllers like the Xbox 360 and PS3 Controllers.
    This means Triggers can be selected along with other axes. The axis and
    button names are displayed in the Controller Config menu for these devices.

Mod:
  [General]
  - Rooftops now shows the proper gfx and length at the track selection screen
    even if the level data is missing.
  - Provide signed parameters for special cars (key cars, Mystery, UFO) to
    remove CHT mention.
  - Automatically restore window upon dismissing a message box in fullscreen
    (Windows only).
  - Linux 'setup' script now sets proper permissions to the 'lib' folder.
  [Graphics]
  - Increased the enumerated number of display modes to 1024 (previously 256).
    The number of display modes is logged to the re-volt.log file.
  [Input]
  - Controller buttons are properly supported for menu navigation: axes can now
    be treated as buttons. Use Fire - forwards (Button A by default) and
    Pause - backwards (Button Y by default).
  [Multi]
  - Disabled the delay added to the multiplayer cars and objects animation.
  - Updated multiplayer animation model, should result in smoother animation
    even at high pings without the need for adding a remote delay.
  - Increased the network packets per second to 20 (from previous 6).
  - Improved debug display in multiplayer (Numpad Enter in Dev mode).

Fix:
  [General]
  - Bug restarting level in reverse / mirror mode in split-screen.
  - Fixed CPU cars info shown in race summary in split-screen even when
    Multiplayer CPU setting is turned off.
  - Fixed key cars locked at the options menu when a race is quit before the
    countdown has ended.
  [Graphics]
  - Possible crash when the number of display modes is above 256.
  - Glitch when switching from windowed to fullscreen at the frontend after
    selecting split-screen mode.
  - Improper menu layout when the window is resized while the menu is animated.
  [Input]
  - Menu navigation not working when controller axes are used as buttons.
  [Multi]
  - Track search unavailable when going back from waiting room.
  - Wrong weapon target when using the 'all weapons' cheat in multiplayer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16.0904a:

  [Audio]
  - Fixed a bug in 3D surround panning.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16.0710a:

Add:
  [General]
  - 64 bit support: this release includes native linux binaries for both 32-bit
    and 64-bit systems (rvgl.32 and rvgl.64).
  - Added 'rvgl' launch script that auto-detects the system type and launches
    either the 32-bit or 64-bit executable. The script automatically resolves
    dependencies by using libs included with rvgl in place of any missing libs.
    This allows rvgl to run without any manual configuration on a wide range of
    distros as long as the opengl drivers, sdl2 and sdl2_image are installed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16.0705a:

Mod:
  [General]
  - Spherical linear interpolation (slerp) code used for remote car animation
    is now closer to the 1207 / DC version.

    can be used for ship levels, 1 can be used for water surfaces.
  [Graphics]
  - Added an fps limiter that can be used with v-sync off. Set the preferred
    frame rate through the LimitFPS entry in rvgl.ini, set it to zero to
    disable limiting. Only 0 or values above 10 are accepted.

Mod:
  [General]
  - Allow 'flying' car AIs to turn in air / water.
  - The camera speed in edit mode is now controlled by the caps lock key.
  - Errors are logged to the console in addition to message box display.

  [Graphics]
  - Use DC style hi-res text for Replay / Spectator / Demo Mode.

Fix:
  [Multi]
  - Fixed clone weapon not working between clients.
  - Fixed player ping display showing wrong ping.
  - Minor lag management improvement, cuts off interpolation based on distance
    between samples. Should avoid cars zooming past, etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16.0305a:

Add:
  [General]
  - Add support for UTF-8 filenames on Linux. This allows the car parameters
    file and level inf to be saved in UTF-8 encoding. The characters that can
    be displayed in-game is still limited to extended ascii (Windows-1252)
    encoding. UTF-8 support is not available on Windows, to be added later.
  [Multi]
  - Display the ping delay in ms above the lagging player cars.

Mod:
  [General]
  - Disabled v-sync by default, avoids input lag with some gfx cards.

    scroll lock to speed up camera.
  - Included the names of artwork contributors in the credits.
  [Multi]

    rename it to revolt.exe, then place dplobby_helper.dll alongside.

Fix:

16.0110a:
| Pumped network version.

Add:
  [Graphics]
  - Re-added support for changing the brightness and contrast. This only works
    in fullscreen, and for the primary monitor in a multi-monitor display. Use
    "-nogamma" command line to disable gamma correction.
  [Audio]
  - Added support for true 3D surround sound. Surround speakers or headphones
    with virtual surround capability are required.
  - Support for the streaming redbook from the PSX master track (TRACK1.DA).
    Convert the master track to OGG and place it in the redbook folder as
    "track1.ogg". Only OGG is supported.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15.1220a:

Add:
  [Graphics]
  - Texture formats support: additional texture formats are now supported. For
    historical reasons, the textures should still be named with the .bmp
    extension (and mipmaps with .bmq, .bmo, etc. as usual).
    Available formats: BMP, PNG, JPG, WEBP, TIF, GIF, CUR, ICO, LBM, PCX, PNM,
    XPM, XV, XCF. Support for XCF (GIMP's native format) is experimental. This
    allows you to visualize a GIMP project file in RVGL without exporting it.
    However, this is not guaranteed to work correctly in all cases.
  - New option in Render Settings to enable or disable the water ripples effect
    (vibrations in water) used in tracks like Garden. This can help improve
    performance with some Intel cards.
  [Audio]
  - Re-added support for MP3 playback on Windows.

Fix:
  [Graphics]
  - Fixed "Spectating" text displayed in demo mode and credits.
  - The "Demo Mode" text in demo mode no longer looks stretched.
  [Audio]

    quickly as you move away from the source. Also fixed an inconsistency in
    panning.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15.1025a:
| Pumped network version.

Add:
  [General]
  - Added "-nopause" command line to keep running the game even when it's in
    the background. This is an alternative to the Shift+F9 shortcut in dev mode.
  [Multi]
  - Added lobby launching support with the command line "-lobby <ip_address>".
    <ip_address> can be the host's IP, 0 (to search for local sessions), or
    entirely ignored (for launching the host).

Fix:
  [General]
  - Fixed potential crash in custom tracks utilizing the Speedup object.
  - Viewport glitches in 3-player split-screen when not using Auto split.
  - Pickups not staying disabled in edit mode.
  - Broken "clear progress table" option.
  - Fixed instances saved using RVGL not loading anymore in previous Re-Volt
    versions. The non-working instances need to be re-saved using the fixed
    rvgl build.

  - First implementation of online multiplayer support. Uses client/server mode
    of communication rather than peer-to-peer. The server binds to UDP port
    2301 (currently hard-coded).
  - Display both the public and private IP address for the host. Public IP is
    queried through "checkip.dyndns.org".
  - Logs various network information to the log file (see lines starting with
    the "NET:" prefix.

Mod:

15.0501a:
| First Alpha release.

Add:
  [General]
  - Language search support: the list of languages supported is no longer
    hard-coded. Instead, any language file can be placed in the strings folder
    and it will be detected by RVGL. The localized language name (eg,
    "Français" for "french.txt") can be specified as the last line of the
    strings file.
  [Graphics]
  - Fullscreen toggle support: use F11 to switch between fullscreen and windows
    mode instantly.
  - Ability to resize the RVGL window in windowed mode to any preferred size.
    The last window size is saved on fullscreen toggle.
  - Auto Generate Mipmaps: All mipmap levels can now be automatically generated
    at loading time (no need for .bmq, ... files). We only recommend using this
    option if Anisotropic filtering is also enabled, otherwise there can be
    excessive blurring.
  - New logo: This release adds the RV Team developer splash screen with a
    disclaimer text and uses a new RVGL logo made by hi-ban for the loading and
    frontend screens.

Mod:
  [General]
  - We now support Unix (LF) line endings for the language files. Previously
    only Windows (CRLF) line endings were supported.
  - RVGL global settings file is named "rvgl.ini" and profile specific settings
    are saved in "profile.ini". Profile names are capitalized in-game.
  - The profile ini entries now use double-quotes to cover string entries like
    level dir, player name, etc. This supports entry with spaces better.
  - The debug log files are now created inside the profiles folder.
  [Graphics]
  - The default resolution is taken from the desktop mode rather than being
    hard-coded to 640x480. In windowed mode, the default size is half the
    desktop dimensions. A different default size can be set using "-window w h"
    command line.
