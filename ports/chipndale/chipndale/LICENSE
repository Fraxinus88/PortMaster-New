The (in)famous remake of the classic NES game Chip & Dale: Rescue Rangers, is now released open-source and completely free. All the levels of original game are recreated block-by-block with new graphics, physics, and improved gameplay. Two player mode (on the same PC) is supported.

The project is open source, which means everyone is free to edit, copy, redistribute the game code and all the assets in any way, no credits are required.
