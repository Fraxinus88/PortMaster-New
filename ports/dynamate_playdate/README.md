## Known bug
<br/>
There is a known bug in the game where if you hold A and press the direction to move a movable piece in, and while its moving and still holding A and pressing another direction before it collides with the last piece, the game does not detect level completed. So make sure to not change the piece directions. This will be adressed in a future update.
