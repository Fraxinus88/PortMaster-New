    <desc>Catacomb II (Renamed to The Catacomb in 1991) contains 30 new levels and a few new monsters in this follow-up to the 1989-1990 release. Petton Everhail, a powerful magician, is hired to recover treasure buried deep beneath the ruins of the Kieralon Palace. The path to the treasure chamber is guarded by goblins, skeletons, ogres, gargoyles, and worse. Catacomb II does not change the game principle of its predecessor, but offers a few new monsters and new levels to explore.</desc>
