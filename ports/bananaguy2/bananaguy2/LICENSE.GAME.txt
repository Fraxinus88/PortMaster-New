Hello! bananamanhatguy, Im part of a team called PortMaster. We port over games to multiple handheld linux devices running custom versions of Linux. Some of your games peeked my interest, but especially Bananaguy2. That particular game i've already gotten running and i would like to ask you to allow us to distribute the .pck files from your free games. Otherwise gamers would have to download the game on itch.io manually. I look forward to hearing back from you, if you are interested in PortMaster, here is a link: https://portmaster.games/
