    <desc>Miss Undefined has been whisked away by the dastardly Kill Screen. Go from Zero to Hero in this fast-paced platformer, chasing time, the high score, and eventually the Kill Screen itself

Super Mega Zero is a tight precision and puzzle platformer with shoot 'em up elements. Simply touch an upgrade and switch forms to go from classic, straight-forward platforming to the more puzzle-like action number system or Shoot' Em Up gameplay.</desc>
