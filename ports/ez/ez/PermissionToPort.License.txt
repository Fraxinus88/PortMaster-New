Hello,

My name is <redacted>, and I'm part of a group of developers working on porting games to handheld Linux devices. Our project is named PortMaster (https://portmaster.games/) , and we also have an active Discord server in which you are very welcome to come check out any time.

From Portmaster, we will supply a package which needs legally obtained game files to be placed in the relevant folders for the game to run. We do not distribute any paid game files.

Are you okay with us releasing such a package which allows the playing of E.Z on these handheld arm-based linux devices? The instructions will be to purchase the game from steam and place the data.win file in a particular folder.

Best regards,
<redacted>
