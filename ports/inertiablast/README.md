## Notes

The rebellion captured several warships but lack the energy pod to power the ships. You are part of a risky expedition to steal the energy pods. Defense systems will attempt to stop you. The energy pods are often stored in tunnels making them hard to retrieve. The massive weight of the pod increases the difficultly in getting out.

Inertia Blast is a remake of an C64 game called Thrust.
