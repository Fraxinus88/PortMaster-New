    <desc>Originally written in 1983 by Matthew Smith. This port is based on the original ZX Spectrum version, written in C and using the SDL2 library.
Game play

Game play is 100% identical except for the following differences:

    Level 16 has the item below the portal slightly lower down and the conveyor has a gap. This forces the player to utilise the left side of the level to get the item and to return to the portal. Judging by the collapsible blocks on the left, this may have been what Matthew Smith originally envisioned.

    In level 19 "Solar Power Generator", air depletes by 8 points if Willy is hit by the light beam unless his Y position is offset and the light beam strikes him vertically, then he loses 12 points of air. That's how the original game works. It should not matter if Willy's Y position is offset as he takes up no more room visually, therefore air depletes by 8 points regardless.

The original game had bugs. These have been fixed, such as landing at the end of a jump into a solid wall.</desc>
