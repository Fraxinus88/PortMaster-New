Actually, we can improve the current port for users by making it "ready to run." It would be fantastic if you could grant permission to include your game assets  (only for the free version) within the port package, so users could simply download the game within our app or site and have it ready to play. Currently, users have to download your files and add them to the port manually

Ok so I grant you the permission to do that for the free version (prologue) only!! Keep in mind that you then need to update it for the few updates it might require (I assume maybe 4 more at max, fixing some bugs)

In now way I can give you that for the full version as this one will be payed. (But as I understand your previous message I see that  you are aware of that ðŸ˜‰ )

Also if possible, I would appreciate if you would include a disclaimer in the prologues port description that players should consider leaving a wishlist on the full version. This would help imensly
