        "desc": "Serious Sam is a high-adrenaline arcade-action shooter heavily focused on frantic arcade-style single player action. Sam travels through the beautiful world of ancient Egypt and several diverse planets, confronting countless Mental\u2019s minions on his way to the Mental\u2019s base. This source port of Serious Sam was originally modded to work on the Dragonbox Pyra handheld. GL video accelerated with GL4ES by ptitseb (same dev who also does box86 and box64)!",
