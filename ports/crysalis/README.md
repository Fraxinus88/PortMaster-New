## Notes

Thanks to Rene P for making this game with RPG Maker VX Ace.

Also thanks to Cebion for compiling mkxp and making this port possible.

## Gamedata

Copy *Crysalis.exe* (extract it from [crysalis.zip](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/additional-downloads)) and *RPGVXAce_RTP.zip* ([RPG Maker VX Ace Run Time Package](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/run-time-package)) in *ports/roms/crysalis*.

The Run Time Package and gamedata will be installed during the first launch. It may take time so be patient.
