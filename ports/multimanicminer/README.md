## Notes

This is a  recreation of the first level, the Central Cavern, of Manic Miner, except it allows up to 4 players to play simultaneously on the same PC.

It's a race to be the first to collect all the keys and then get back to the flashing waffle-type thing, using either gamepads or the keyboard.

Thanks to [Steven Smith](https://github.com/SteveSmith16384/ManicMinerMultiplayer) for this game.
