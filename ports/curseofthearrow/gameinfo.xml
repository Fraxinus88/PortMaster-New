    <desc>Explore areas, solve puzzles, and fight against the curse that was imposed on you by an ancient statue! Your only weapon is a bow and a single arrow to defend yourself against your own corruption! Use your arrows as platforms, fight against enemies, toggle switches, and push boxes, and die (over and over)! </desc>
