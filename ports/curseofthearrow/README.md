## Notes

Huge thanks to [Egor Dorichev ](https://egordorichev.itch.io/) for creating this amazing game. On top of that he even made it open-source! Check out the original sourcecode [here](https://github.com/egordorichev/CurseOfTheArrow). If  you like the game, I highly suggest supporting the dev by buying the incredible [OST](https://egordorichev.itch.io/curse-of-the-arrow) for example.
