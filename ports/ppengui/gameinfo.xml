    <desc>It looks like the penguin is having a bad day. Flaming thugs have cut off your nap and now are destroying the silent cave.

Help the penguin to end the party before things get too hot!

 

HOW TO PLAY

Eliminate all invaders using your egg bomb, but beware of hot areas as you will have difficulty moving through them.

You can restore the ice using your snotty sneeze. It will undo the heat and can also block enemies.

In case you end up getting stuck, sneeze over a block to break it. Use the bomb timer to your advantage.. also it is possible to push it forward in order to make a surprise attack!
