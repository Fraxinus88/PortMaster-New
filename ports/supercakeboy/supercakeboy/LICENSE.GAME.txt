Hello I am from the Portmaster server and am involved in the porting of GameMaker games onto arm based handheld devices made from companies such as anbernic/powkiddy.

You may read more on the project on http://portmaster.games/

In internal testing, Super Cakeboy is working great and is a blast to play and I am wondering if you would allow Portmaster to distribute the game. An alternative is for users to download the game from steam and place the relevant files into the correct folders for the game to work.

Regardless, this is a really fun game and thank you for making it ðŸ™‚

good morning
generally I have no problem with fans modding or providing mirrors for my games just as long as they aren't re-selling it
so if you're not making money off the distribution of the game, then go nuts

Can do and thank you for making this game! And looking to port your other games like Khimera as well. 
If I do manage to get Khimera: Puzzle Island Working, then for Portmaster we will provide the packaging for the game to run but all paid assets will be obtained from steam.
Thank you once again for making these really fun games! they play great on these handhelds
