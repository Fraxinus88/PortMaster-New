    <desc>OCDA is a precision platformer in which you play as an animated potato who also just happens to somehow be literate.

Run and jump your way through levels, find secrets and master your ability to dash. It's just you, the game and your tenacity to continue.

The game is short and sweet, but offers more content in the form of hunting collectibles and secrets.

Clearing the game unlocks speedrun mode as well. Post your fastest time in the comments!</desc>
