Hey everyone, Linky439 here!

A small listing of what's new in this v1.1:
- Time Attack mode that stores up to 8 records for each track
- Gamepad support, with controls set to (for a standard X360 controller, should work fine with a PS* controller):
	* "A button" => A
	* "B button" => B/X
	* "D-pad" => D-pad/Left joystick
	* "Start button" => Start
	* "Boost" => Shoulder buttons LB/RB/Up on D-Pad/Left joystick
- Bug fixes
	* Glitches for the "Rival" icon whenever you retried a race
	* Mines are now less brutal
	* Improve the display for Road Quality < Very High => the car is now placed at the correct y-position!
	* Prevent moving in menus during screen transition
	* You could pause and "retry" the results screen causing it to crash
	* Dying in lava did not spawn an ambulance
	* Colliding with walls now reduce your speed a bit
	* AI no longer get stuck inside pitfalls (v1.1.3 - 2020/11/06)

It is unknown whether I will produce another version of the game, so I hope you'll enjoy it.
Have fun, and let's all keep believing that the Captain will fly again on a Nintendo console one day!
